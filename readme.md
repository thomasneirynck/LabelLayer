# LabelLayer


## What
Fast on-the-fly HTML/CSS label placement with conflict detection. Labels will not overlap.
Conflict detection is greedy, based on label priority.
Style your labels using <em>everything</em> that HTML/CSS has on offer.


## Why
Vanilla HTML/CSS is significantly more expressive than most libraries that use svg, HTML5-canvas, or WebGL.
